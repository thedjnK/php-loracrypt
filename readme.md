# php-loracrypt

This project aims to bring native LoRa encryption/decryption functions to PHP 7+ (and possibly PHP 5), with a direct port to a HHVM extension.

The basic LoRa functions have already been implemented with some limited testing, the code will be pushed to this repository once they are fully implemented and tested.
