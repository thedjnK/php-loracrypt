# php-loracrypt

This project aimed to bring native LoRa encryption/decryption functions to PHP 7+ (and possibly PHP 5), with a direct port to a HHVM extension, however the last modification to this incomplete code was made in January and I have no plans to update this code again.

The basic LoRa functions have been implemented with some limited testing. I offer no support or guarantee that the code works.
